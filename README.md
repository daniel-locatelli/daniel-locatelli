### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Daniel Locatelli. I am an architect-programmer.
As a kid I would disassemble and fix my RC cars for fun. Since joining the AEC industry, this has not changed: I am figuring out how to disassemble and fix this industry so it can work properly again.

I am currently diving deep into the software development world. And I have to say, combining it with the AEC industry may have been my Ikigai this whole time.

A little bit more about me:
- ðŸŒ² Currently working at [BuildSystems](https://buildsystems.de/ "Build sustainable. Build smart. Build systems."). We help AEC developers and Homeowners build sustainably without losing touch with reality ðŸ’¶.
- ðŸ“± I am diving deep into Angular to bring Web Apps we have already conceptualized to life.
- I graduated from FAU-USP in Brazil and earned an M.Sc. from ITECH at the University of Stuttgart. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything related to computational design and digitalization in AEC.

As a first step, I have converted my CV to a database, detaching my information from the user interface (separating concerns). This allows me to be platform-independent while also opening the possibility to create tools to query and filter information about me.


To do: linktree for social media
