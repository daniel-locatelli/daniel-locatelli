### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is the repo for my official website.
<br>
As a first step, I have converted my CV to a database, detaching my information from the user interface (separating concerns). This allows me to be platform-independent while also opening the possibility to create tools to query and filter information about me.

A little about me in the meantime:
- ðŸŒ² Currently working at [BuildSystems](https://buildsystems.de/ "Build sustainable. Build smart. Build systems."). We help AEC developers build sustainably without losing touch with reality ðŸ’¶.
- ðŸ“± I'm learning Angular and Django to bring to life a couple of Web Apps we have already conceptualized.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything related to computational design and digitalization.


# Angular readme file

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
