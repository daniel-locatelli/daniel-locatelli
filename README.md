### Hi there 👋

A little about me:
- 🌲 Currently working at [BuildSystems](https://buildsystems.de/ "Build sustainable. Build smart. Build systems."). We help AEC developers and Homeowners build sustainably without losing touch with reality 💶.
- 📱 I am diving deep into Angular to bring Web Apps we have already conceptualized to life.
- 💬 Ask me anything related to computational design and digitalization in AEC.

This is the repo for my future portfolio.

As a first step, I have converted my CV to a database, detaching my information from the user interface (separating concerns). This allows me to be platform-independent while also opening the possibility to create tools to query and filter information about me.


To do: linktree for social media
