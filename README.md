### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Daniel Locatelli. I am an architect-programmer.

I am currently diving deep into software development. And I have to say, building apps was my Ikigai this whole time.

I am
- ðŸŒ² Currently at [BuildSystems](https://buildsystems.de/ "Build sustainable. Build smart. Build systems.") where we help AEC developers and Homeowners build sustainably and affordably.
- ðŸ“± Working with Angular to bring Web Apps we have already conceptualized to life.
- ðŸ’» Building [my own portfolio](https://daniellocatelli.com/ "Daniel Locatelli's Portfolio") with Astro and using Notion as a CMS.
- ðŸŽ“ Graduated from FAU-USP in Brazil and earned an M.Sc. from ITECH at the University of Stuttgart in Germany.

This is the repo for my future portfolio.

As a first step, I have converted my CV to a database, detaching my information from the user interface (separating concerns). This allows me to be platform-independent while also opening the possibility to create tools to query and filter information about me.


To do: linktree for social media
