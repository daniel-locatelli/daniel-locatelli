### Hi there 👋

This is the repo for my official website.
<br>
As a first step, I have converted my CV to a database, detaching my information from the user interface (separating concerns). This allows me to be platform-independent while also opening the possibility to create tools to query and filter information about me.

A little about me in the meantime:
- 🌲 Currently working at [BuildSystems](https://buildsystems.de/ "Build sustainable. Build smart. Build systems."). We help AEC developers build sustainably without losing touch with reality 💶.
- 📱 I'm learning Angular and Django to bring to life a couple of Web Apps we have already conceptualized.
- 💬 Ask me anything related to computational design and digitalization.
